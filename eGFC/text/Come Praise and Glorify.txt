Title: Come Praise and Glorify

Come pr[A]aise and glorif[Em7]y our God
The F[D]ather of our L[A]ord
In Chr[A]ist He has in h[Em7]eav’nly realms
His bl[D]essings on us p[A]oured

For p[F#m]ure and bl[A]ameless [D]in His sight
He d[F#m]estined [A]us to be[D]
And n[A]ow we’ve been ad[Em7]opted through
His S[D]on eternally[A]

To the pr[F#m]aise of Your gl[E]ory
To the pr[A]aise of Your mercy and gr[D]ace
To the pr[F#m]aise of Your gl[E]ory
Y[G2]ou are the G[D]od who s[A]aves

Come praise and glorify our God
Who gives His grace in Christ
In Him our sins are washed away
Redeemed through sacrifice

In Him God has made known to us
The myst’ry of His will
That Christ should be the head of all
His purpose to fulfill

To the praise of Your glory
To the praise of Your mercy and grace
To the praise of Your glory
You are the God who saves

Come praise and glorify our God
For we’ve believed the Word
And through our faith we have a seal
The Spirit of the Lord

The Spirit guarantees our hope
Until redemption’s done
Until we join in endless praise
To God, the Three in One

To the praise of Your glory
To the praise of Your mercy and grace
To the praise of Your glory
You are the God who saves
