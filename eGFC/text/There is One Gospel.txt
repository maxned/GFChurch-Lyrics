Title: There is One Gospel

There [A]is one Gospel on wh[D]ich I stand
For [A]all eternit[E]y
It [A]is my story, my F[D]ather's plan
The S[A]on has r[E]escued m[A]e

[A]Oh what a Gospel, Oh wh[D]at a p[A]eace
My h[D]ighest j[A]oy and my d[F#m]eepest n[E]eed
N[A]ow and for[B#m7]ever He [A]is my l[E]ight
I st[D]and in the G[A]ospel of J[E]esus Chr[A]ist

There is one Gospel to which I cling
All else I count as loss
For there, where justice and mercy meet
He saved me on the cross

No more I boast in what I can bring
No more I carry the weight of sin
For He has brought me from death to life
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

There is one Gospel where hope is found
The empty tomb still speaks
For death could not keep my Savior down
He lives and I am free

Now on my Savior, I fix my eyes
My life is His and His hope is mine!
For He has promised I, too, will rise
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

And in this Gospel the church is one
We do not walk alone
We have His Spirit as we press on
To lead us safely home

And when in glory still I will sing
Of this old story that rescued me
Praise to my Savior, the King of life
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ
2x

Praise to my Savior, the King of life
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ
