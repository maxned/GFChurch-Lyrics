Title: Have Your Sins Been Washed in the Flow

Have your sins been washed in the flow
From the cross on dark Calvary?
And the One Who died do you know?
That from sin you might ransomed be?

On the cross forsaken was He
From the cross His blood trickled down
That mankind from sin could be free
For the cross exchanged He His crown

Though like scarlet your sins may be
Heavy though the weight of your woe
His blood can make you free from sin
It can make them whiter than snow

Jesus called, and I did reply
“Come to Me,” He said. I did go!
What I was no longer am I
His blood made me whiter than snow

Like the wayward lamb, I had strayed
“Pastures green” were silver and gold
On the cross atonement was made
Jesus brought me back to the fold

Though like scarlet your sins may be
Heavy though the weight of your woe
His blood can make you free from sin
It can make them whiter than snow

Contemplating, I love to see
From the cross the life-giving flow
To us bringing grace, full and free
By it making us white as snow

Though like scarlet your sins may be
Heavy though the weight of your woe
His blood can make you free from sin
It can make them whiter than snow
