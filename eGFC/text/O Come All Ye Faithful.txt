Title: O Come All Ye Faithful

O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of nations

O, come let us adore Him
O, come let us adore Him
O, come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

God from true God, and
Light from Light eternal
Born of a virgin, to Earth He comes
Only-begotten Son of God the Father

O, come let us adore Him
O, come let us adore Him
O, come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to God
Glory in the highest

O, come let us adore Him
O, come let us adore Him
O, come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
O, come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
