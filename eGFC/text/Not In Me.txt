Title: Not In Me

Verse 1
No list of sins I have not done
No list of virtues I pursue
No list of those I am not like
Can earn myself a place with You

O God! Be merciful to me
I am a sinner through and through
My only hope of righteousness
Is not in me, but only You

Verse 2
No humble dress, no fervent prayer
No lifted hands, no tearful song
No recitation of the truth
Can justify a single wrong

My righteousness is Jesus' life
My debt was paid by Jesus' death
My weary load was borne by Him
And he alone can give me rest

Verse 3
No separation from the world
No work I do, no gift I give
Can cleanse my conscience, cleanse my hands
I cannot cause my soul to live

But Jesus died and rose again
The pow'r of death is overthrown
My God is merciful to me
And merciful in Christ alone

Tag
My righteousness is Jesus' life
My debt was paid by Jesus' death
My weary load was borne by Him
And he alone can give me rest
