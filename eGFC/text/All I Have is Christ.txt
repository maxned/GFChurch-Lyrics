Title: All I Have is Christ.pro

Hallelujah!
All I have is Christ
Hallelujah!
Jesus is my life

I once was lost in darkest night
Yet thought I knew the way
The sin that promised joy and life
Had led me to the grave

I had no hope that You would own
A rebel to Your will
And if You had not loved me first
I would refuse You still

But as I ran my hell-bound race
Indifferent to the cost
You looked upon my helpless state
And led me to the cross

And I beheld Godâ€™s love displayed
You suffered in my place
You bore the wrath reserved for me
Now all I know is grace

Hallelujah!
All I have is Christ
Hallelujah!
Jesus is my life
2x

Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone
And live so all might see
The strength to follow Your commands
Could never come from me

Oh Father, use my ransomed life
In any way You choose
Oh Father, use my ransomed life
In any way You choose
And let my song forever be
My only boast is You

Hallelujah!
All I have is Christ
Hallelujah!
Jesus is my life
3x
