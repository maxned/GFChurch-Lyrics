Title: Christ Our Hope in Life and Death

Verse 1
What is our hope in life and death?
Christ alone, Christ alone
What is our only confidence?
That our souls to Him belong

Who holds our days within His hand?
What comes, apart from His command?
And what will keep us to the end?
The love of Christ, in which we stand

Chorus
O sing, hallelujah!
Our hope springs eternal
O sing, hallelujah!
Now and ever we confess
Christ our hope in life and death

Verse 2
What truth can calm the troubled soul?
God is good, God is good
Where is His grace and goodness known?
In our great Redeemer’s blood

Who holds our faith when fears arise?
Who stands above the stormy trial?
Who sends the waves that bring us nigh
Unto the shore, the rock of Christ?

Chorus
O sing, hallelujah!
Our hope springs eternal
O sing, hallelujah!
Now and ever we confess
Christ our hope in life and death

Verse 3
Unto the grave, what shall we sing?
“Christ, he lives; Christ, he lives!”
And what reward will heaven bring?
Everlasting life with Him

There we will rise to meet the Lord
Then sin and death will be destroyed
And we will feast in endless joy
When Christ is ours forevermore

Chorus
O sing, hallelujah!
Our hope springs eternal
O sing, hallelujah!
Now and ever we confess
Christ our hope in life and death
