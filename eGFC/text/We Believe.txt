Title: We Believe.pro

In this time of desperation
When all we know is doubt and fear
There is only One Foundation
We believe, We believe

In this broken generation
When all is dark, You help us see
There is only One Salvation
We believe, We believe

We believe in God the Father
We believe in Jesus Christ
We believe in the Holy Spirit
And He's given us new life!

We believe in the crucifixion
We believe that He conquered death
We believe in the resurrection
And that He's coming back again!
We believe

So, let our faith be more than anthems
Greater than the songs we sing
And in our weakness and temptations
We believe, We believe!

We believe in God the Father
We believe in Jesus Christ
We believe in the Holy Spirit
And He's given us new life!

We believe in the crucifixion
We believe that He conquered death
We believe in His resurrection
And He's coming back again!

Let the lost be found 
and the dead be raised!
In the here and now, let love invade!
Let the church live love our God will see
We believe, We believe!

And the gates of hell will not prevail!
For the power of God, has torn the veil!
Now we know Your love will never fail!
We believe, We believe!

We believe in God the Father
We believe in Jesus Christ
We believe in the Holy Spirit
And He's given us new life!

We believe in the crucifixion
We believe that He conquered death
We believe in the resurrection
And He's coming back,
He's coming back again!
He's coming back again!
We believe, We believe

Psalm 9:1-2 

1 I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart;
    I will recount all of your wonderful deeds.
2 I will be glad and exult in you;
    I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.
