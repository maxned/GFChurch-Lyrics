Title: Come Thou Fount

Come, Thou Fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy, never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount, I'm fixed up on it
Mount of Thy redeeming love

I was lost in utter darkness
â€™til You came and rescued me
I was bound by all my sin when
Your love came and set me free

Now my soul can sing a new song
Now my heart has found a home
Now Your grace is always with me
And I'll never be alone

Come, Thou Fount, come, Thou King
Come, Thou precious Prince of Peace
Hear Your bride, to You we sing
Come, Thou Fount of our blessing
2x

O, to grace, how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

Come, Thou Fount, come, Thou King
Come, Thou precious Prince of Peace
Hear Your bride, to You we sing
Come, Thou Fount of our blessing
2x

I was lost in utter darkness
'til You came and rescued me
I was bound by all my sin when
Your love came and set me free

Now my soul can sing a new song
Now my heart has found a home
Now Your grace is always with me
And I'll never be alone
