Title: The Lord Almighty Reigns

Th[G]ere's an [C]endless s[G]ong
W[G]aiting t[C]o be s[G]ung
W[C]ith the voice of [G]every tribe
The s[Em7]ound of every t[Dsus]ongue

When the bride of Christ
On that day of days
Brings with joy unto the Lamb
A multitude of praise

And l[G]ike the roar of m[C]ighty seas
And r[A]olls of thunder
H[D]ear His p[Bm7]eople s[C]ing

Hallel[G]ujah, hallelujah
For the L[C]ord Almighty r[G]eigns
Hallel[Em7]ujah, hallel[D]uj[G]ah
For the L[C]ord, our G[Dsus]od,
The Alm[C]ight[D]y r[G]eigns

We will join the feast
Rest from battles won
Tell with great rejoicing
All the wonders God has done

And like the roar of mighty seas
And rolls of thunder
All the church will sing

Hallelujah, hallelujah
For the Lord Almighty reigns
Hallelujah, hallelujah
For the Lord, our God,
The Almighty reigns

C[Em]ertain [C]of that d[G]ay
Christ we will procl[D]aim
[C]Oh, that more would sh[G]are the prize
Salv[Em7]ation in His n[Dsus-D]ameâ€¦

Then gr[G]eater will the [C]anthem ring
The m[A]ighty chorus r[D]ising t[Bm7]o the K[C]ing

Hallel[G]ujah, hallel[Em7-D-G]ujah
For the L[C]ord Almighty r[G]eigns
Hallel[Em7]ujah, hallel[D]uj[G]ah
For the L[C]ord, our G[D]od,
The Alm[C]ight[D]y r[G]eigns
