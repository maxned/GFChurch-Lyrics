Title: Who is Like the Lord

Saints and servants, hosts of heaven,
All creation, praise the name of the Lord!
Night and morning, sing His glory,
Now and forevermore

Earthly kingdoms, all dominions,
Bow before Him, praise the name of the Lord!
None as holy, none as worthy,
Now and forevermore

Crowned with adoration,
He is high above the nations!
Who is like the Lord our God?
Who is like the Lord our God?

Our Lord Jesus wore our weakness
To redeem us, praise the name of the Lord!
In His kindness He will keep us
Now and forevermore

Crowned with adoration,
He is high above the nations
Who is like the Lord our God?
Raised us from the ashes,
He has turned our grief to gladness
Who is like the Lord our God?
Who is like the Lord our God?

High and holy, meek and lowly
There is no one like You
Our Messiah, here beside us
There is no one like You

Crowned with adoration,
He is high above the nations
Who is like the Lord our God?
Raised us from the ashes,
He has turned our grief to gladness
Who is like the Lord our God?
Who is like the Lord our God?

There is no one like our God!
