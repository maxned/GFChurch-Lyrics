Title: My Soul Will Wait (Psalm 62)

Verse 1
When the enemy surrounds
And my heart grows faint within
When the darkness overwhelms
And my fears are pressing in

Pre-Chorus
I will trust in You, O Lord
In the silence I will wait
I will stand upon Your Word

Chorus 1
You’re my solid rock and my salvation
My steadfast hope that won’t be shaken
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

Verse 2
You’re my stronghold and my shield
In the midst of every threat
Though the wicked never yield
They will vanish like a breath

Pre-Chorus
Yes, I know the outcome’s sure
Satan’s evil plans will fail
In Your power I’m secure

Chorus 1
You’re my solid rock and my salvation
My steadfast hope that won’t be shaken
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

Chorus 2
You’re my comfort when I feel forsaken
My refuge and my sure foundation
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

Verse 3
This is love I can’t explain
This is mercy unreserved
Through Your sacrifice so great
I have peace that’s undeserved

Pre-Chorus
For the battle has been won
And I fear no shame or loss
Now the sting of death is gone

Chorus 1
You’re my solid rock and my salvation
My steadfast hope that won’t be shaken
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

Chorus 2
You’re my comfort when I feel forsaken
My refuge and my sure foundation
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

Bridge
Pouring out our hearts before You
We will trust in You
Perfect Savior, strong defender
We will trust in You
