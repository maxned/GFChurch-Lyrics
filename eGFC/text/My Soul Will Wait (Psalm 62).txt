Title: My Soul Will Wait (Psalm 62)

When the [D]enemy surrounds and my heart grows faint within
When the darkness overwhelms and my fears are pressing in
I will tr[Em7]ust in You, O L[A]ord, in the s[D]ilence [A]I will w[G]ait
I will st[Em7]and upon Your W[A]ord

You’re my s[D]olid rock and my salvation
My st[Em7]eadfast hope that won’t be sh[D]aken
My s[G]oul will wait, my s[A]oul will wait for Y[D]ou

You’re my stronghold and my shield, in the midst of every threat
Though the wicked never yield, they will vanish like a breath
Yes, I know the outcome’s sure, Satan’s evil plans will fail
In Your power I’m secure

You’re my solid rock and my salvation
My steadfast hope that won’t be shaken
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

You’re my comfort when I feel forsaken
My refuge and my sure foundation
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

This is love I can’t explain, this is mercy unreserved
Through Your sacrifice so great, I have peace that’s undeserved
For the battle has been won, and I fear no shame or loss
Now the sting of death is gone

You’re my solid rock and my salvation
My steadfast hope that won’t be shaken
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

You’re my comfort when I feel forsaken
My refuge and my sure foundation
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

P[D]ouring out our h[Em7]earts before You
W[G]e will trust in Y[D]ou
Perfect Savior, strong defender
We will trust in You
