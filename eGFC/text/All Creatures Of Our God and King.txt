Title: All Creatures Of Our God and King

All creatures of our God and King
Lift up your voice and with us sing
O praise Him! Alleluia!

Thou, burning sun with golden beam
Thou, silver moon with softer gleam
O praise Him! O praise Him!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

Let all things their Creator bless
And worship Him in humbleness
O praise Him! Alleluia!

Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son
And praise the Spirit, Three-in-One
O praise Him! O praise Him!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

All the redeemed washed by His blood
Come and rejoice in His great love
O praise Him! Alleluia!

Christ has defeated every sin
Cast all your burdens now on Him
O praise Him! O praise Him!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

He shall return in powâ€™r to reign
Heaven and earth will join to say
O praise Him! Alleluia!

Then who shall fall on bended knee?
All creatures of our God and King
O praise Him! O praise Him!
Alleluia! Alleluia!

O praise Him! O praise Him!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
