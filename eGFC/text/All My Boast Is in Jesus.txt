{Intro}

{Verse 1}
What wonder of wonders, what love is this
That Christ would die for me
His goodness, His merit, His righteousness
This sinner’s only plea
O foolish pride, be crucified
The work is finished

{Chorus}
All my boast is in Jesus
All my hope is His love
And I will glory forever
In what the cross has done

{Verse 2}
Now fully forgiven, my life is filled
With graces undeserved
For mercy that flowed down that sacred hill
Let praises now return
Rise up my soul, and bless the Lord
Who else is worthy?

{Chorus}

{Bridge}
O praise the One forever blessed
Him alone my heart adores
And I will boast in nothing less
Than the love of Christ my Lord
2x

{Verse 3}
I boast not in riches, in strength or might
But in the grace of God
I glory in weakness, to live is Christ
In plenty or in want
That I may know, that all may see
His pow’r within me

{Chorus}

{Chorus 2}
Now I stand in this freedom
Ransomed, clean in His sight
And I cannot be ashamed for
My boast is Jesus Christ
My boast is Jesus Christ
Forever my boast is Jesus Christ

{Outro}
