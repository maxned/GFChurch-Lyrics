Title: I Will Praise Him Again

Wh[C]y, my soul, are you d[F]owncast?
Wh[C/E]y are you troubled with[Gsus]in?
F[C]or I will h[Dm]ope in my S[Am]aviour, my G[F]od
And will praise Him, yet pr[Gsus]aise Him ag[C]ain
2x

Hallelu[F-C]jah, hallel[F-C]ujah
Hallel[F-G-Am]ujah
I will pr[F]aise Him, yet pr[Gsus]aise Him ag[C]ain
2x

M[F]orning by morning, new mercies are streaming
I tr[C]ust in your goodness where [G]I cannot see
Y[F]ou have been faithful whenever I wandered
Lord, g[C]ive me the hope that I n[G]eed
2x

Hallelu[F-C]jah, hallel[F-C]ujah
Hallel[F-G-Am]ujah
I will pr[F]aise Him, yet pr[Gsus]aise Him ag[C]ain

Wh[C]y, my soul, are you d[F]owncast?
Wh[C/E]y are you troubled with[Gsus]in?
F[C]or I will h[Dm]ope in my S[Am]aviour, my G[F]od
And will pr[Dm]aise Him, y[C/E]et pr[F]aise Him ag[C]ain
