Title: Christ Our Wisdom

Verse 1
Christ our wisdom, we are humbled
When You hide Your ways from us
You have purposes unnumbered
Each one good and glorious

Chorus 1
Help us trust when we grow weary
Free us from our anxious thoughts
Give us grace to see more clearly
You are God and we are not

Verse 2
Christ our wisdom, be our gladness
When we fail to understand
You ordain all joy and sadness
To fulfill Your perfect plan

Chorus 2
Help us know You rule with power
Over every raging flood
In our most uncertain hour
You are God and we are loved

Verse 3
Christ our wisdom, we will follow
Though the way ahead is veiled
As we journey through the shadows
Grant us faith where sight has failed

Chorus 3
Help us cling to Your commandments
Strengthened by Your faithful word
We will never be abandoned
You are God and we are Yours

Verse 4
Christ our wisdom, we adore You
For the beauty of the cross
Once in foolishness we scorned You
But Your blood has ransomed us

Chorus 4
Help us sing the endless mercies
Of Your humble heart to save
Christ our wisdom, Christ our glory
You are God forever praised
