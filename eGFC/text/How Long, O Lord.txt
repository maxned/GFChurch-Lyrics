Title: How Long, O Lord

Every valley will be lifted high
And the weak will be the strong
When You come like lightning in the sky
How long, O Lord, how long?

Kings on earth will scatter when they hear
Thundering sounds of angel songs
Hearts will tremble filled with holy fear
How long, O Lord, how long?

All our hopes are fixed on You
That Your promises are true
And one day You will return
All our treasures here will fade
So we long to see Your face
Until then our hearts will burn
How long, O Lord?

You will conquer every evil thing
Every sorrow pain and wrong
They will cease with Your return our King
How long, O Lord, how long?

All our hopes are fixed on You
That Your promises are true
And one day You will return
All our treasures here will fade
So we long to see Your face
Until then our hearts will burn
How long, O Lord?

How long, O Lord? (How long, O Lord?)
How long, O Lord? (How long, O Lord?)
How long, O Lord? (How long, O Lord?)

All our hopes are fixed on You
That Your promises are true
And one day You will return
All our treasures here will fade
So we long to see Your face
Until then our hearts will burn
How long, O Lord?

How long, O Lord?
How long, O Lord?
How long, O Lord?
