Title: Ancient of Days

Though the n[C]at[Am]ions r[G]age
Kingdoms r[Dm]ise and f[Am]all
There is st[F]ill one K[C]ing
Reigning [Am-D-G]over all
So I w[C]ill n[A]ot f[G]ear
F[C]or this tr[F]uth r[G]em[Am]ains:
That my G[F]od is the [G]Ancient of D[C]ays

None ab[F]ove Him, none bef[Am]ore Him
All of t[F]ime in H[G]is h[C]ands
For His thr[F]one, it shall rem[Am]ain and ever st[G]and
All the p[F]ower, all the gl[Am]ory
I will tr[F]ust in H[G]is n[C]ame
For my G[F]od is the [G]Ancient of D[C]ays

Though the dread of night
Overwhelms my soul
He is here with me
I am not alone
O His love is sure
And He knows my name
For my God is, the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

Though I may not see
What the future brings
I will watch and wait
For the Savior King
Then my joy complete
Standing face to face
In the presence of the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days 2x
