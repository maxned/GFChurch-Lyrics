Title: Angels We Have Heard on High

Verse 1
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Gloria in excelsis Deo 2x

Verse 2
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavn'ly song?

Gloria in excelsis Deo 2x

Verse 3
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, the newborn King

Gloria in excelsis Deo 2x

Verse 4
See Him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While our hearts in love we raise

Gloria in excelsis Deo 2x
