Title: How Vast the Love.pro

Come gaze upon your Savior
Behold your great High Priest
Draw near in awe and wonder
His cross has spoken peace

Come rest from sin and striving
Find endless stores of grace
The heart that turns to Jesus
Is cleansed from every stain

Oh, how deep, how wide, how long
Oh, how vast the love of Jesus
Oh, how sure, how sweet, how strong
Oh, how vast His love for us

So lift your eyes to Jesus
Arise from doubt and shame
His blood cries, ‘It is finished!’
Our life is in His name

Oh, how deep, how wide, how long
Oh, how vast the love of Jesus
Oh, how sure, how sweet, how strong
Oh, how vast His love for us

What now can separate us?
Can death or pain or fear?
We have this strong assurance
In Christ we’ve been brought near

And in His strength we’ll labor
His promises our hope
Thus far His love has led us
His love will lead us home!

Oh, how deep, how wide, how long
Oh, how vast the love of Jesus
Oh, how sure, how sweet, how strong
Oh, how vast His love for us
