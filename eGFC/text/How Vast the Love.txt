Title: How Vast the Love.pro

Come g[C]aze upon your Savior
Beh[Am]old your great High Pr[F]iest
Draw n[C]ear in awe and wonder
His cr[Am]oss has spoken p[F]eace

Come r[C]est from sin and striving
Find [Am]endless st[G]ores of gr[F]ace
The h[C]eart that turns to Jesus
Is cl[Am]eansed from every st[G]ain

Oh, how d[F]eep, how wide, how l[C]ong
Oh, how v[Am]ast the love of J[G]esus
Oh, how s[F]ure, how sweet, how str[C]ong
Oh, how va[Am]st His love for [C]us

So lift your eyes to Jesus
Arise from doubt and shame
His blood cries, ‘It is finished!’
Our life is in His name

Oh, how deep, how wide, how long
Oh, how vast the love of Jesus
Oh, how sure, how sweet, how strong
Oh, how vast His love for us

What n[C]ow can separate us?
Can d[F2]eath or pain or fear?
We have this strong assurance
In Christ we’ve been brought near

And [C]in His str[Dm]ength we’ll l[F]abor
His pr[Am]omis[G]es our h[F]ope
Thus f[C]ar His l[Dm]ove has l[F]ed us
His l[Am]ove will l[F]ead us h[G]ome!

Oh, how deep, how wide, how long
Oh, how vast the love of Jesus
Oh, how sure, how sweet, how strong
Oh, how vast His love for us
