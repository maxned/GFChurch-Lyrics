Title: How Great (Psalm 145)

I’ll bless Your name, O God, each day that I awake
From dawn to setting sun, Your greatness I’ll proclaim
Your glory far exceeds all human thought
So with each breath I’ll bless Your name, O God

Your name will be revered by children yet to come
As generations sing of wonders You have done
Your strong and mighty deeds are always near
O God Most High, Your name will be revered

How great is the Lord and greatly to be praised!
How great is the Lord our God
How great is the Lord and greatly to be praised!

Your gracious hand provides for all who live and breathe
Your mercy runs to find the helpless and the weak
When we call out to You, You hear our cries
And all our needs Your gracious hand provides

How great is the Lord and greatly to be praised!
How great is the Lord our God
How great is the Lord and greatly to be praised!

Forever without end, creation will rejoice
When works of wicked men, You finally destroy
Your power we’ll proclaim till Christ descends
And You will reign forever without end

How great is the Lord and greatly to be praised!
How great is the Lord our God
How great is the Lord and greatly to be praised!
