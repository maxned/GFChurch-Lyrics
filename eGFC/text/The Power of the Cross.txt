Title: The Power of the Cross

Verse 1
Oh, to see the dawn of the darkest day
Christ on the road to Calvary
Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten, then
Nailed to a cross of wood

Chorus
This, the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

Verse 2
Oh, to see the pain written on Your face
Bearing the awesome weight of sin
Every bitter thought, every evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow

Chorus
This, the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

Verse 3
Now the daylight flees, now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head
Curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life
‘Finished!’ the vict'ry cry

Chorus
This, the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

Verse 4
Oh, to see my name written in the wounds
For through Your suffering I am free
Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

Chorus
This, the power of the cross
Son of God, slain for us
What a love! What a cost!
We stand forgiven at the cross
