Title: The Goodness of Jesus

C[C]ome you weary heart now to J[F]esus
C[C]ome you anxious soul now and s[F]ee
Th[Am]ere is perfect l[G]ove and c[C]omfort in your t[F]ears
R[Gsus4]est here in His w[G]ondrous p[C]eace

Oh the g[F]oodness, the goodness of J[C]es[G]us
Satisf[F]ied He is [Am]all that I n[G]eed
May it b[Am]e, come what m[F]ay, that I r[C]est all my d[F]ays
In the g[Gsus4]oodness of J[G]es[C]us

Come find what this world cannot offer
Come and find your joy here complete
Taste the living water, never thirst again
Rest here in His wondrous peace

Oh the goodness, the goodness of Jesus
Satisfied He is all that I need
May it be, come what may, that I rest all my days
In the goodness of Jesus

Come and find your hope now in Jesus
He is all he said He would be
Grace is overflowing from the Saviorâ€™s heart
Rest here in His wondrous peace

Oh the goodness, the goodness of Jesus
Satisfied He is all that I need
May it be, come what may, that I rest all my days
In the goodness of Jesus
2x

May it be, come what may, that I rest all my days
In the goodness of Jesus
