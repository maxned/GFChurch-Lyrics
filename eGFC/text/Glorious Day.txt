Title: Glorious Day

One day when heaven was filled with His praises
One day when sin was as black as could be
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
Dwelt among men, my example is He
Word became flesh and the light shined among us
His glory revealed

Living He loved me
Dying He saved me
Buried He carried
My sins far away

Rising He justified, freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day

One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain
One day they nailed Him to die on a tree
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected
Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He
Hands that healed nations stretched out on a tree
And took the nails for me

Living He loved me
Dying He saved me
Buried He carried
My sins far away

Rising He justified, freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day

One day the grave could conceal Him no longer
One day the stone rolled away from the door
Then He arose over death He had conquered
Now He's ascended, my Lord evermore
Death could not hold Him
The grave could not keep Him from rising again

Living He loved me
Dying He saved me
Buried He carried
My sins far away

Rising He justified, freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day
Glorious day

One day the trumpet will sound for His coming
One day the skies with His glories will shine
Wonderful day my beloved One is bringing
My Savior Jesus is mine

Living He loved me
Dying He saved me
Buried He carried
My sins far away

Rising He justified, freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day
Glorious day, oh glorious day
