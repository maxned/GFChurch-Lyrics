Title: God Is For Us

W[C]e won’t fear the battle
W[F]e won’t fear the n[C]ight
W[F]e will walk the v[C]alley,
W[Am]ith You by our s[G]ide

You will go before us
You will lead the way
We have found a refuge,
Only You can save

S[C]ing with joy now: [F]our God is f[C]or us
[F]The Father's l[C]ove is a str[Am]ong and mighty f[G]ortress
Raise your voice now, no love is greater
Who can stand against us if our God is for us

Even when I stumble
Even when I fall
Even when I turn back,
Still Your love is sure

You will not abandon
You will not forsake
You will cheer me onward
With never ending grace

Sing with joy now: our God is for us
The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress
Raise your voice now, no love is greater
Who can stand against us if our God is for us

Neither h[F]eight nor depth can s[G]eparate us
H[Am]ell and death will n[C]ot defeat us
H[F]e who gave His S[G]on to free us
H[Am]olds me in His l[C]ove
2x

Sing with joy now: our God is for us
The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress
Raise your voice now, no love is greater
Who can stand against us if our God is for us
