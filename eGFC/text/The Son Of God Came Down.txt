Title: The Son Of God Came Down

The Son of God came down
And laid aside His crown
Born without great renown
This Sovereign One

All holiness and might
All glory shining bright
Have come to earth this night in Maryâ€™s son
O come, let us adore

O Christ the Lord, our hope and Savior
Son of God yet made like us
O Christ the Lord, our King adored
Born a child, our Lord Jesus

Messiah born so small
Asleep in cattle stall
Come to redeem our fall
Nailed to a tree

This tiny, helpless child
Through death would reconcile
The holy God and vile, His grace so free
O come, let us adore

O Christ the Lord, our hope and Savior
Son of God yet made like us
O Christ the Lord, our King adored
Born a child, our Lord Jesus
