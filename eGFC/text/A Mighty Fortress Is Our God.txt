Title: A Mighty Fortress Is Our God

Verse 1
A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing
Our Helper He amidst the flood, of mortal ills prevailing
For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe
His craft and power are great, and armed with cruel hate
On earth is not his equal

Verse 2
Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing
Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God's own choosing
Dost ask who that may be, Christ Jesus—it is He
The Lord of hosts His name, from age to age the same
And He must win the battle

Verse 3
And though this world with devils filled should threaten to undo us
We will not fear for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us
The prince of darkness grim, we tremble not for him
His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure
One little word shall fell him

Verse 4
That word above all earthly powers, no thanks to them abideth
The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him Who with us sideth
Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also
The body they may kill, God’s truth abideth still
His kingdom is forever
