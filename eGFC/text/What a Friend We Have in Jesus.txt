Title: What a Friend We Have in Jesus

Verse 1
What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer

Pre-Chorus
Oh, what peace we often forfeit
Oh, what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer

Verse 2
Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer

Pre-Chorus
Can we find a Friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer

Chorus
Oh, what a friend
Oh, what a friend in Jesus
2x

Verse 3
Are we weak and heavy laden
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge
Take it to the Lord in prayer

Pre-Chorus
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer
In His arms He'll take and shield thee
Thou wilt find a solace there

Chorus
Oh, what a friend
Oh, what a friend in Jesus
2x
