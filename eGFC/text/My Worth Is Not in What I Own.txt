Title: My Worth Is Not in What I Own

My w[C]orth is not in wh[F]at I [C]own
Not in the strength of fl[F]esh and b[C]one
But in the costly w[G]ounds of l[Am]ove
[F]At the cr[C]oss

My worth is not in skill or name
In win or lose, in pride or shame
But in the blood of Christ that flowed
At the cross

[F]I rejoice in m[G]y Red[Am]eemer
Greatest Tr[F]easure,
Wellspring [C]of my s[G]oul
[F]I will trust in H[G]im, no [Am]other.
My soul is s[C]atisf[F]ied in H[G]im al[C]one.

As summer flowers we fade and die
Fame, youth and beauty hurry by
But life eternal calls to us
At the cross

I will not boast in wealth or might
Or human wisdom’s fleeting light
But I will boast in knowing Christ
At the cross

I rejoice in my Redeemer
Greatest Treasure,
Wellspring of my soul
I will trust in Him, no other.
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.

Two wonders here that I confess
My worth and my unworthiness
My value fixed – my ransom paid
At the cross

I rejoice in my Redeemer
Greatest Treasure,
Wellspring of my soul
I will trust in Him, no other.
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.
