Title: I Will Trust My Savior Jesus

I will trust my Savior Jesus
When my darkest doubts befall
Trust Him when to simply trust Him
Seems the hardest thing of all

I will trust my Savior Jesus
Trust Him when my strength is small
For I know the shield of Jesus
Is the safest place of all

Jesus, only Jesus
Help me trust You more and more
Jesus, only Jesus
May my heart be ever Yours

I will trust my Savior Jesus
He has said His way is best
And I know the path He's chosen
Leads to everlasting rest

Jesus, only Jesus
Help me trust You more and more
Jesus, only Jesus
May my heart be ever Yours
2x

Oh on that cross
How it was seen
I can go now ever trusting
In the One who died for me
What could I bring
For Your gift is complete
So I trust You, simply trust You
Lord, with every part of me
3x

Jesus, only Jesus
Help me trust You more and more
Jesus, only Jesus
May my heart be ever Yours
2x
