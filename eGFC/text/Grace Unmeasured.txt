Title: Grace Unmeasured.pro

Grace unmeasured, vast, and free
That knew me from eternity
That called me out before my birth
To bring You glory on this earth

Grace amazing, pure, and deep
That saw me in my misery
That took my curse and owned my blame
So I could bear Your righteous name

Grace (grace, grace)
Paid for my sins
And brought me to life
Grace (grace, grace)
Clothes me with power
To do what is right

Grace (grace, grace)
Will lead me to heaven
Where I'll see Your face
And never cease
To thank You for Your grace

Grace abounding, strong, and true
That makes me long to be like You
That turns me from my selfish pride
To love the cross on which You died

Grace unending all my days
You'll give me strength to run this race
And when my years on earth are through
The praise will all belong to You

Grace (grace, grace)
Paid for my sins
And brought me to life
Grace (grace, grace)
Clothes me with power
To do what is right

Grace (grace, grace)
Will lead me to heaven
Where I'll see Your face
And never cease
To thank You for Your grace

Grace (grace, grace)
Paid for my sins
And brought me to life
Grace (grace, grace)
Clothes me with power
To do what is right

Grace (grace, grace)
Will lead me to heaven
Where I'll see Your face

And never cease
To thank You for Your grace
