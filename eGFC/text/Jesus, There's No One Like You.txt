Title: Jesus, There's No One Like You.pro

There is no song we could sing
To honor the weight of Your glory
There are no words we could speak
To capture the depth of Your beauty

Jesus, there’s no one like You
Jesus, we love You, ever adore You
There’s no one like You
Jesus, we love You, ever adore You, Lord

There is no sinner beyond
The infinite stretch of Your mercy
How can we thank You enough
For how You have loved us completely?

Jesus, there’s no one like You
Jesus, we love You, ever adore You
There’s no one like You
Jesus, we love You, ever adore You

There’s no one like You
Jesus, we love You, ever adore
There’s no one like You
Jesus, we love You, ever adore You, Lord

All we have
All we need
All we want is You

Jesus, there’s no one like You
Jesus, we love You, ever adore You
There’s no one like You
Jesus, we love You, ever adore You

There’s no one like You
Jesus, we love You, ever adore
There’s no one like You
Jesus, we love You, ever adore You, Lord
