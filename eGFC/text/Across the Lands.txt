Title: Across the Lands.pro

You're the Word of God the Father
From before the world began
Ev'ry star and ev'ry planet
Has been fashioned by Your hand

All creation holds together
By the power of Your voice
Let the skies declare Your glory
Let the land and seas rejoice

You're the Author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands

Yet You left the gaze of angels
Came to seek and save the lost
And exchanged the joy of heaven
For the anguish of the cross

With a prayer You fed the hungry
With a word You stilled the sea
Yet how silently You suffered
That the guilty may go free

You're the Author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands

With a shout You rose victorious
Wrestling vict'ry from the grave
And ascended into heaven
Leading captives in Your way

Now You stand before the Father
Interceding for Your own
From each tribe and tongue and nation
You are leading sinners home

You're the Author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands
