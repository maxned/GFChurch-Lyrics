Title: Jesus Is The Lord

Jesus Christ, crucified
Bled and died to save our lives
Giver of boundless love
Faithful One to You we run

Every knee will bow
Every tongue will shout
Jesus is the Lord, Jesus is the Lord
And every eye will see
The coming of the King
Jesus is the Lord, Jesus is the Lord

Son of Man, Great I Am
Healing power is in Your hands
Risen One, It is done
Sin and death are overcome

Every knee will bow
Every tongue will shout
Jesus is the Lord, Jesus is the Lord
And every eye will see
The coming of the King
Jesus is the Lord, Jesus is the Lord

You're worthy of worship
You're worthy of praise
You're worthy of honor
You're worthy of thanks
4x

Every knee will bow
Every tongue will shout
Jesus is the Lord, Jesus is the Lord
And every eye will see
The coming of the King
Jesus is the Lord, Jesus is the Lord
