Title: How Low Was Our Redeemer Brought.pro

[Am-C-G-D]Intro

Verse 1
How [Am]low was our Redeemer [C]brought
The [G]King who held the [D]stars
Lay [Am]helpless in a maiden’s [C]arms
And [G]pressed against her [D]heart

While [C]sheep and cattle raised their [F]voice
The [Am]babe could speak no [Dm]words
The [Am]ever [G]flowing [Em]Spring of [D]Joy
Had [F]come to share our [G]thirst

Verse 2
How low was our Redeemer brought
The Lord the worlds obeyed
Would stumble as He learned to walk
Upon the ground He’d made

The One the angels bowed before
Would kneel to wash our feet
And be at home among the poor
Though He owned everything

Chorus
Glori[F]a, glori[G]a in the [F]high[C]est
Glori[F]a, glori[G]a in the [F]high[C]est

Verse 3
How low was our Redeemer brought
To raise us from our shame
And now the highest praise of all
Belongs to Jesus’ name

The Healer wounded on a tree
To bear our grief and sin
The King gave up His crown so we
Could ever reign with Him

Chorus
Gloria, gloria in the highest
Gloria, gloria in the highest
2x

Chorus
Gloria, gloria in the highest
Gloria, gloria in the highest
2x

How low was our Redeemer brought
To raise us from our shame
And now the highest praise of all
Belongs to Jesus’ name
